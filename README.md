# Breast-cancer-risk-prediction

# Welcome to my GitHub repository on Using Predictive Analytics model to diagnose breast cancer.
## Objective:
# The repository is a learning exercise to:

* Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
* Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set
* Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process.
* The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository

* Identifying the problem and Data Sources
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Pre-Processing the Data
* Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is malignant or Benign

## Help in detecting breast cancer with 99.122% of accuracy
